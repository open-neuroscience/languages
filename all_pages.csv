3,1,About,"Hi! This website is my first effort in both website creation and promoting open source science. As mentioned before, the more people sticking their noses into science, either to tinkering with their own projects, or ""simply"" by reading current literature and through these methods, better understanding science and seeing its purpose, the better!!

I hope you find the website useful! Drop me a line with ideas, suggestions, criticisms, other open science/projects and suggestions at: openeuroscience(<em>at)</em>gmail.com

(remember to replace the <em>at</em> for @ ;)! )

4,1,Hardware,"&nbsp;

Here you will find information about existing open hardware platforms, which can be used for several different tasks.

&nbsp;

There are projects such as the <a href=""http://www.arduino.cc/"">Arduino</a>, or the <a href=""http://www.brc-electronics.nl/"">SimpleCortex</a>, which are microcontrollers that can be loaded with different programs to control different sensors and devices.

&nbsp;

Other projects that aim to offer a cheap alternative for desktops, while doing more than desktops... Good examples in this category are the <a href=""http://beagleboard.org/#&amp;slider1=1"">Beagle board</a> and the <a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/"">Raspberry pi</a> (although the latter is not completely open).

&nbsp;

On the wetware class, we have open PCR, and centrifuges available

&nbsp;

Last but not least, there are also complete electrophysiology systems available. In this category are the <a href=""https://backyardbrains.com/"">Backyard brains</a> and the <a href=""http://open-ephys.org/"">Open ephys</a> initiative.

7,0,Arduino,"&nbsp;

The best description about the arduino project comes from their own <a href=""http://www.arduino.cc/"" target=""_blank"">website</a>:
<blockquote>""Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for artists, designers, hobbyists, and anyone interested in creating interactive objects or environments.""</blockquote>
But unfortunately they forgot about scientists!! This is a great platform for:

-Learning a little bit of electronics which is always handy in a laboratory, whether you simply want to understand how that PCR machine really works or to understand how to fix that damn TTL pulse that is constantly failing.

-Building full operational setups at much lower cost than the current commercial systems, one arduino UNO board cost ~50€ and a <a href=""http://store.arduino.cc/product/A000010"">beginner kit</a>, with LEDs, buttons, resistors and other sensors can be bought for around ~60€.

To put in more practical words, the Arduino is a micro controller that has several digital inputs/outputs as well as analog inputs and also outputs. It runs up to 16MHz of speed, and is normally programmed with a special designed language, that is actually a simplified version  of C++, which can also be used instead (for people who already know how to program in c++).
There is a nice series of videos from the people of <a href=""http://fritzing.org/"">Fritzing</a>, showing how to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E779EfPLI4"">get started</a> with eletronics and the Arduino

23,2,"Open access journals","Here is a small list of peer reviewed open access journals that I'm aware about (if you know more, let me know!):

<a href=""https://peerj.com/"">PeerJ</a>: They charge a one time only fee and you can publish there for your entire career.

<a href=""http://www.elifesciences.org/"">eLife</a>: They are not charging for publication at this point, and their reviewing process is a little bit more centred at the <a href=""http://www.elifesciences.org/the-journal/review-process/"">editor's hands</a>

<a href=""http://www.plos.org/"">PLOS</a>: probably the best known open access initiative out there, but they charge the publication fees from the authors instead of charging the readers.

<a href=""http://www.frontiersin.org/"">The Frontiers family</a>: Frontiers is a open access publisher that follows the recipe of charging authors, but they have the great idea of making the reviewer's and editor's name public, so that in every paper, one can see who were the ""guilty ones"" for allowing that specific paper out.

Doing a small research for ""Open access journals"" once can find a lot of them (great!), I haven't had the time to go through all of them in detail, but here is a list:

<a href=""http://www.biomedcentral.com/"">BioMed central</a>: They work the same way as PLOS, by charging the authors.

<a href=""http://www.springeropen.com/"">SpringerOpen</a>: The open branch of Springer

<a href=""http://www.wileyopenaccess.com/view/index.html"">Wiley Open Acces</a>: The open branch of Wiley

<a href=""http://www.doaj.org/"">Directory of Open Access Journals</a>: here one can find open access journals through a search engine.

<a href=""http://f1000.com/"" target=""_blank"">Faculty of 1000</a>: Really thinking outside the box, this publisher has mainly four services (as in 22/01/2014): <a href=""http://f1000.com/prime"" target=""_blank"">F1000Prime</a> has a commented selection of papers in biology and medicine, recommended by over 5000 Faculty Members. <a href=""http://f1000.com/trials/about"" target=""_blank"">F1000Trials</a> has a commented selection of published clinical trials.<a href=""http://f1000research.com/"" target=""_blank""> F1000Research</a> is an open access journal, with a post publication peer review system. Papers are published after an in-house editorial check as long as all data used in the paper is also made available. After publication, the paper is peer reviewed (reviewers names are public!) and the revision steps are tracked and indicated. Last but not least, <a href=""http://f1000.com/posters"" target=""_blank"">F1000Poster</a>s is a repository of posters and slide presentations, making all the effort to put up together a nice presentation/poster less useless, since they will have much more visibility than a conference's time.

<a href=""http://www.gigasciencejournal.com/"">GigaScience</a>: is a general biomedical- life science journal that focuses on big data studies. Interestingly they want to provide the normal manuscript together with a database to host data used to generate the article, tools for data analysis and cluster computing facilities.

A more comprehensive list has been done by <a href=""http://emckiernan.wordpress.com/"">Erin C. McKiernan</a>, and can be found <a href=""http://emckiernan.wordpress.com/2012/10/19/publishing-open-access-in-neuroscience/"">here</a>.

37,0,SimpleCortex," <p>&nbsp;</p>
The <a href=""http://www.brc-electronics.nl/"">SimpleCortex</a> is an initiative from a group of electronics students that felt that the Arduino project missed a few things, such as a debugger, a nicer programming environment and some more ""muscle"". This board runs at 120 MHz, has more digital IO ports and more analog inputs than the Arduino boards.

Having never used Simplecortex myself I cannot say more about it. But they seem to keep a constant update of the board and it's functionalities and also new shields that can be used to expand the board capabilities, such as a LCD shield, that could be used by those neuroscientists working with visual systems.

48,0,"The &quot;Beagles&quot;"," <p>&nbsp;</p>
The <a href=""http://beagleboard.org/"">Beagle boards</a> are open source, fanless, low cost (a <a href=""http://beagleboard.org/bone"">beagle bone</a> costs $89) computers that can run different OSs such as línux, and Android. They come stripped from peripherals, which makes them great for personal customization. They come in three flavours, the beagle bone, the beagle board and the beagle board XM.

The <a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/"">Raspberry Pi</a> is the product of a project that searches to spark the interest of kids into things such as programming and hardware developement. The boards are really cheap (starting at around 25€) although being a complete computer (it can play high definition media and connect to the internet) that runs linux and can easily be used as an environment for learning python, or other programming languages. Even if it is not an open source piece of hardware (due to one of the chips they use in their board), it is still worth mentioning, since this can be an easy, cheap device used to set up a small prototyping rig.

59,1,Software,"But what is open source software? and why should I use it?

-To put it in a short, short way, open source software are pieces programs that are free (as in liberty). Anyone can look at the program's code, study it, make custom changes to it or even improve it, finding bugs and so on.

Open source software is present in almost all areas of computation, from wide use operational systems (such as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux"">Linux</a>, <a href=""http://www.freebsd.org/about.html"">FreeBSD</a>), 3D modelling (<a href=""http://www.blender.org/"">Blender</a>, <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/projects/free-cad/"">Freecad</a>), office suites (<a href=""http://www.openoffice.org/"">Open office</a>, <a href=""http://www.libreoffice.org/#0"">Libre office</a>), vectorized image suites (<a href=""http://inkscape.org/"">Inkscape</a>), photoshop like suites (<a href=""http://www.gimp.org/"">Gimp</a>), programming languages with scientific computing add-ons (<a href=""http://www.python.org/"">python</a> and <a href=""http://www.numpy.org/"">numPy</a>), high level programming languages for numerical computation (<a href=""http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/"">GNU Octave</a>).

<span style=""color: #000000;"">This website is an attempt in promoting free, mostly open source projects that can be used for scientific projects. Being a neuroscientist, most of the projects here will have neuroscience oriented examples/ideas, but this doesn't mean they cannot be used at any other area of science.</span>

<span style=""color: #000000;"">The reasoning for putting all these projects together is that if someone has a good hypothesis on how a certain natural principle could be explained, lack of funding is too much of a mediocre reason for the testing of such a hypothesis not to happen. Also, a big portion of science is funded with public money, therefore using free/open source projects allows better use of the money.</span>

<span style=""color: #000000;"">The saving potential is huge; as a small example, a <a style=""color: #000000;"" href=""http://sine.ni.com/nips/cds/view/p/lang/en/nid/14129"">National Instruments card</a> that is commonly used for digital and analog I/Os costs around 1500.00 € (<a style=""color: #000000;"" href=""http://sine.ni.com/nips/cds/view/p/lang/en/nid/14129"">not including special cables required, and block connectors</a> ). An <a style=""color: #000000;"" href=""http://arduino.cc/"">Arduino board</a>, that has similar capabilities and could be used for most behavioural testing paradigms costs 20.00 € and can be controlled by a free ""made easy"" programming language.

<span style=""color: #000000;"">Science and education are strongly correlated with prosperity and therefore should be much more accessible to everyone; If more people have access to it, the probability of bringing development to any region of the globe <a style=""color: #000000;"" href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/william_kamkwamba_how_i_harnessed_the_wind.html"">increases</a>.</span>

<span style=""color: #000000;"">Therefore, if us scientists can save some money that can be put to other use, and make our own processes more accessible, that more people can dialogue on the same level, then this is already a good reason to search for open source alternatives.</span>

81,1,"GNU Octave","<a href=""http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/"">GNU Octave</a> is a high level interpreted language thought for numerical computation. The language itself is quite similar to matlab, so existing programs/scripts should be portable. Here is a bit about the software from the authors themselves:
<blockquote>Just about everyone thinks that the name Octave has something to do with music, but it is actually the name of one of the author's former professors who wrote a famous textbook on chemical reaction engineering, and who was also well known for his ability to do quick ""back of the envelope"" calculations.

One of R’s strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where needed. Great care has been taken over the defaults for the minor design choices in graphics, but the user retains full control.

<p>Microcontrollers are small boards that allow the interaction of computers with the real world, going beyond mouse, keyboard and video camera. They normally run in the Mega Hertz frequency range (which allows more than enough precision for behavioural paradigms and psychophysical tasks) and have a wide range of digital inputs and outputs, so one can send and receive TTL pulses. They also have analogue inputs and outputs, which allows the reading of sensors (such as temperature, infra-red, accelerometers) and controlling of motors or the intensity of a LED. All of this is achieved by running custom written code (one can find several examples of code on the internet to get started).</p>

Due to their small size and cost, are great for customization and mobile applications and some of them even feature microcontroller properties, being able to input/output TTL pulses.

Two open source alternatives are available, costing much less, and being more portable.

Overall explanation:

The script running on the arduino IDE, which controls LEDs, used as fixation point, exogenous cues and targets and monitors a button press. The script controls the task and sends via serial port some data: trial number, if the trial was aborted or not (due to improper button press), LED cue side, delay between onset of fixation point and onset of cue, LED target side, delay between cue LED offset and target LED onset and reaction time (delay between target LED onset and button press).

A python script running on the computer which creates a folder and a file with the subjects name and opens the serial port to record the data being sent from the arduino. The data read is stored as readable strings in a text file.

Afterwards, the files can be read in your favorite programming language/data analyses software for further analyses (I intend to put some code for data analyses of this task as well).

The <a href=""https://potterlab.gatech.edu/main/newman/wiki/index.php?title=Cyclops_Driver_R2"">Cyclops Driver R2</a> is a PCB that can drive high power LEDs. It has been used primary for optogenetic stimulation of neurons, but it can be used to drive LEDs for any application where a fast switching, ultra-stable, and high power light source is required (e.g. fluorescent imaging). Text taken from <a href=""https://potterlab.gatech.edu/main/newman/wiki/index.php?title=Cyclops_Driver_R2"">here</a>

<blockquote>The Open Science Framework (OSF) is part network of research materials, part version control system, and part collaboration software. The purpose of the software is to support the scientist's workflow and help increase the alignment between scientific values and scientific practices.&nbsp;</blockquote>

The project offers cloud space for uploading of project outline, materials, workflow, individual contributions and their extent to a specific project. All of that with the option of having all data publicly or privately available. The idea is to allow a more transparent and innovative system where people can see what is being done in ""real-time"", contribute and even take up on ideas from other people so that the wheel doesn't have to be reinvented, the system also allows for proper citation, so that the ""wheel inventors"" won't go uncredited.

As an example of what can be done through the Open Science Framework, one can cite the <a href=""http://openscienceframework.org/project/EZcUj/wiki/home"">Reproducibility Project</a> which is a project that aims at checking the reproducibility of ~150 sample studies from cognitive and psychological sciences.

<a href=""http://psychtoolbox.org/"">Psychtoolbox</a>, or PTB, is a free versatile toolbox to be used mainly in visual experiments, it is able to deliver visual and auditory stimuli and to receive subject input. It has a big quantity of active users (15,000 as stated on their <a href=""http://psychtoolbox.org/forum/"">website</a>) what should make the life of the beginner user somehow easier (they have a <a href=""http://psychtoolbox.org/forum/"">forum page</a>) The latest version (PTB-3 as this page was written) is able to run under MATLAB (version 7.X) and Octave (version 3.2.X) in any of the three main operational systems out there (Mac, Windows and Linux).  A paper describing the toolbox can be found <a href=""http://color.psych.upenn.edu/brainard/papers/Psychtoolbox.pdf"">here.</a>

One of the very things being decentralized is the funding source for research projects. This movement is called crowdfunding, and it is already present and strong for other areas, such as funding of technological, and social projects. They are organized via specialised websites that puts people needing funding with people who are willing to support it:

The idea is somewhat simple. Researchers make a video of what their project/research idea is and ask for a certain value to fund the project. If people find the idea interesting they make a donation via the website hosting that project.

There are normally two types of funding options, fixed, where the researchers only get the money pledged if the donations reach that value (or pass it, and if the minimum is not reached the money is returned to the pledgers), or variable where the researchers get to keep the money raised even if it didn't reach the amount pledged for. In both cases the website keeps a percentage of the money raised in case the funding is successful.

Articles about it can be founded <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2013/nov/11/science-research-funding-crowdfunding-excellence"">here</a> and <a href=""http://www.nyas.org/publications/EBriefings/Detail.aspx?cid=82c4e4b4-f200-49b3-b333-c41e1e2f46aa"">here</a>

On the open source community these machines have been thriving and there are several models out there, with differences on the material they use to create the objects (plastic, metal, <a href=""http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/12/131218100227.htm"">live tissue</a>, <a href=""https://chocedge.com/3dprinting.php"">edibles</a>, resins), the way materials are deposited, and build complexity. The plans for building one can be downloaded for free, or kits can be bought (as in 19/02/14) for as little as 400€.

On the research framework, these machines can be used to print customizable lab equipment, such as a <a href=""http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:28298"">lab jack</a>, <a href=""http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:62693"">lens holder</a>, <a href=""http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:239105"">motorized micropositioners,</a> and <a href=""http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:159052"">micropippetes</a>.

Of course there have been *simulated* software organisms in the past, but OpenWorm differs from these in that it seeks to build the worm by simulating its constituent parts (cells, neurons, proteins, etc.) in software, and allowing the behaviour and full organism to emerge from this, much like how the behaviour of <em>C. elegans</em>, and any organism for that matter, is a function of its interacting parts.

An interesting facet of the OpenWorm project is, of course, its <em>openness</em>. By using and creating open source software to help accomplish the project's ultimate aim, the full benefits of the open source movement are realized, including the ability for anyone to contribute or audit code, or see how the project functions at whichever level they like.

The project has volunteers from all over the world and across a multitude of scientific disciplines, including neuroscience, mathematics, neuroinformatics, molecular biology and many more.

1101,6,"LED Panels","In fields related to vision, stimulus presentation is always an issue due to slow refresh rates on commercial monitors/projectors. One way to circumvent this problem is to use LEDs  arranged in a matrix to present stimuli, that can be driven at much higher refresh rates, but have a worst resolution than monitors. Below two examples of such panels:

<blockquote>This is done in realtime and pixelvalues are recalculated before display.

This is still too fast so i had to add 30 ms delay between the frames or we would not perceive it as a fluid animation but rather just blinking bright light.</blockquote>

The <strong>motivation</strong> to start this project arises when we started to include a new behavioral paradigm in the lab, an alternation T-mace with return arms (like the one in Wood e<em>t al. </em>2000). We wanted a clean performance, as well as a clean video record, so we consider necessary to interfere neither with the animal attention (mice, how they are!) nor the camera’s field of view. I decided then to give a try to the new hobby I was getting into, “Do-It-Yourself” (DIY) stuff.

In my head, it was pictured very simple. At the end of the day, I just needed a) something to detect the animal passing by, b) something to deliver a drop of water and c) something to make it happen in a coordinated way. And that’s what Autoreward2 is, no more, no less.

Well perhaps it is a bit more. <strong>So far, the project can</strong>:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Detect </strong>when the animal reaches the end of any of the two arms.</li>
 	<li><strong>Deliver</strong> a small drop of fluid through the corresponding licking port (easy to make it happen in the opposite, if wanted).</li>
 	<li>Give visual cues to the experimenter, indicating which arm has been reached.</li>
 	<li>Allow to <strong>select</strong> different modes of working for different working protocols: ‘Waiting for selection’, ‘Habituation’, ‘Training’, ‘Experimental’ and “Filling and cleaning” modes (and is ready to include more!).</li>
</ul>
To achieve it, I decided for very <strong>simple approach</strong>. A couple of cheap infrared emitters are continuously read by an UNO R3 board. Breaking any of the beams triggers the signal to open the corresponding solenoid valve, connected to the fluid tank. That lets the liquid flow by gravity for around 75 milliseconds, resulting in a single drop at the tip of the licking port.

<img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1395"" src=""https://www.openeuroscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/IMG_26072017_123026_HDR-300x250.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""250"" />

There is a delay after each detection, to avoid repetitive delivery if animals don’t leave the area. A couple LEDs mounted in the bare-board (out of animal sight) light up when the process is triggered, one for each side. They also work as indicators for the ‘Waiting for selection’ mode, when they are continuously on, meanwhile no option is choose or the ‘return to waiting mode action’ is pressed.

<strong>The selection</strong> is made through a 4x4 membrane keypad. Right now, only options 1 to 4 are programmed, making up to 12 more programs available! When any section is made, the in-built LED blinks the corresponding times and the system is ready to work. At any moment, pressing any key makes the system reset to the waiting mode. As easy as that.

Everything is <strong>powered</strong> by a regular 9V wall adapter, giving 3.3V to the LEDs and Infrared detectors, and 9V to the solenoids. Of course, it is possible to use a 9V batterie to power it. To avoid damage coming from the solenoid discharges, the circuit is protected by a couple of diodes at this level.

And that’s all, <strong>it’s simple</strong>. The most important thing: it <strong>works</strong>. The other most important thing: it costs around<strong> 80€</strong>. Here is the to-buy list (or equivalent):
<ul>
 	<li>Elegoo UNO R3 (I found them for <strong>10€</strong>, with USB cable)</li>
 	<li>BreadBoard + Acrylic base (<strong>7€</strong>)</li>
 	<li>9V 1A Wall power supply (<strong>9€</strong>)</li>
 	<li>2x InfraRed beams, 5mm (<strong>15€</strong> both, the 3mm ones are even cheaper)</li>
 	<li>2x Mini-Solenoid valves (<strong>10€</strong> both)</li>
 	<li>2x red LEDs</li>
 	<li>4x 1 KΩ resistors</li>
 	<li>2x TIP120 Transistors</li>
 	<li>2x 1N4001 diodes</li>
 	<li>Wiring (set of jumpers for less than <strong>10€</strong>)</li>
 	<li>‘Velcro’ to attach the acrylic base where the boards are mounted.</li>
 	<li>Plastic tubing and laboratory sample tubes, modified with turning siringe tips to attach/deattach the tubing easily.</li>
 	<li>2x or 4x weak magnets to fix the tubes to the walls.</li>
</ul>

<div class=""siteorigin-widget-tinymce textwidget"">

From Brazil, I've moved to Germany to study neurosciences. In 2010 I founded Open Neuroscience (http://www.openeuroscience.com) with the hope to make neurosciences more accessible across the globe.

Going deeper and deeper into the use of open source technologies for science and education, in 2013 I started a collaboration with TReND in Africa (http://www.trendinafrica.org) and in 2015 I became one of the editors of the Open source toolkit Channel of PLOS (https://channels.plos.org/open-source-toolkit).

My latest project is Prometheus Science (http://www.prometheus-science.com), a startup dedicated to bringing open source scientific equipment to the masses.
